Upmost respect for #CR7 as he’s one of the greatest of all time , but he was in a rush to leave #Juventus late last summer and put Juve in a jam as it was near the transfer window for a return back to #ManUtd in which wasn’t a great decision . He should have stayed .

Fantastic news for McKennie, the #USMNT and #Juventus. Bad news for my productivity tomorrow since I'll now be tuning in from work.

Juventus are closing in on the Depay deal. Documents will be sent to the player's lawyers soon. Deal is well advanced.

#Juventus #Depay

Manchester United have agreed a contract with Rabiot. The club will pay 15+5 million pounds to Juventus for the midfielder✅

#MUFC #Rabiot #Juventus https://t.co/rEGV3J8iRF

A great idea by #LoMonaco. Why not try to offer an agreement with #Belotti while he's free, Mr. @andagn, and Mr. #Arrivabene? He's suitable for #Vlahovic vice at #Juventus. I think, he'll accept the offer. Who doesn't want to play at #UCL, right? https://t.co/wcsRGtADU5

[@Gazzetta_it via @AroundJuventus]

⚠️ Memphis #Depay, along with his lawyer, keep working with #Barça to find an agreement on the contract resolution. But it shouldn't be excluded that #Juventus could be asked for a contribution of a couple millions to resolve this issue.

#EmersonPalmieri is the possible reinforcement for the left side following the departure of #Pellegrini to #Eintracht. #Juventus have restarted the contacts for the Italo-brazilian fullback.

“It’s hard not to be satisfied with the coach’s achievements this year”

Dear #SGE brothers, I was in #VillarPerosa last week, where #Juventus plays every year a friendly and get together with fans. #Pellegrini was warming up next to where I was sitting. Many fans were saying that he’d be in the starting 11 instead of Alex Sandro.

Ballon d’Or rankings:
Cristiano Ronaldo in his first year at an average Juventus side: 3rd Place.
Leo Messi in his first year at star-studded PSG: Excluded from the list.
Never a debate.

🗣#MUFC's deal with Adrian Rabiot is on the verge of collapsing due to the players extreme wage demands.

Ten Hag has guaranteed the player a key role within the team but the players mother is asking for astronomical wages of £12M a year which is double his £6M at #Juventus ⏳

The latest rumours out of the UK suggest the clubs in contact with #Chelsea for #Emerson are #Atalanta, #NottinghamForest &amp; possibly soon #Juventus. 🤔 https://t.co/iQXLHeliUl

Which has also lended some validity in the #Martial to #Juventus rumors. He has told his agent to look for moves ever since #CR7 has come back to training and is looking for a way out now. He feels disrespected. 

His "injury" last weekend was essentially a transfer request.

#Chelsea should look at picking up Kulisewski from #Juventus. It would wind #Spurs right up. 😆

📰📢#Kostic will almost certainly wear number 17, the same number he is currently wearing for Serbian NT. #Juventus

#ManUnited are still in talks with #Rabiot’s mother. If this deal falls through they will go for #Torino midfielder Samuele #Ricci.  Rabiot’s mother is the only thing holding up the deal; full agreement between the clubs.
